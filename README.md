# dManage
An open source software for managing academics
# Initial ideas setting up
As of now we are planning to do a repository based on the JSP servlet. There are several issues associated with the same, but the idea behind remains a UI friendly interface preferably in JSP with functionalities embedded within the same, quite similar to  our DSS. There should be separate database mostly postgres for the work done.

Separate logins for students, faculties, staff and ultimately admin should be there. The students should be able to login check their marks, faculties should be able to enter the mark of students as **.csv** files or **.xls** files. The staff should be able to access the data of several students batch wise or individually and should be limited to certain aspects defined earlier.
Contribute the initial ideas to the project.
